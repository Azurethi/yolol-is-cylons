# yolol-is-cylons
A collection of resources related to yolol, its community standards, and what we hope it can become.

Yolol is a simple scripting language created for the upcoming game [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/) by [Frozenbyte](https://www.frozenbyte.com/). Almost every item in the world of Starbase contains fields and actions which can be controlled by yolol, so the language has the potential to find its way into every level of gameplay.

## Goals
The goal is for this to be a community collection of yolol information ranging from general usage of yolol, to answers of developer questions, to standard practices for yolol, and even to what we hope can eventually be achieved with the language.

## Folders
This repo contains a number of folders for separating information into different groups. Each folder has a specific use case which is explained below.
- **/information/:** for general information about yolol and how it can be used
- **/meta/**: archives various things about the our community itself
- **/thinktank/:** used to hold ideas, concepts, and suggestions for new work with yolol
- **/resources/:** a collection of user-made resources to help development and design

## Got a question?
If you have a question about an aspect of yolol within Starbase, start a github issue with the `Developer Question Template` issue template. The developers will hopefully answer the question in the near future, at which point we'll transwer the information from the answer into the repository.

## How to contribute
Anyone is free to contribute to the information held here. We welcome anything that works towards increasing the sum of knowledge available to the community on how to use yolol to its full potential.

Most of the information should be written in the markdown format (.md files) which includes this very readme! Github uses markdown as an easy way to write rich text without much hassle. Github even has their own flavour of markdown, appropriately called Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM), which has a [guide available](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## What's with the name? What's yolol-is-cylons mean?
**Cylon**, or the **C**ollaborative **Y**olol **L**earning **O**nline **N**etwork, is a discord server dedicated to forming a central repository of yolol knowledge (this repo!), teaching said knowledge, and fostering research into new knowledge. We seek to be an open community where anyone can come to cultivate yolol knowledge. If you're interested in joining us, please do:

Cylon is not a faction, we operate as a community that anyone and everyone, regardless of affiliation, is welcome to join. We do seek collaboration with major factions to further our goal, but only as a tool to spread the word of our mission. Think of us like one of those non-profit associations that a bunch of huge companies back to build their industry, only for yolol and Starbase.

The term "Cylon" is of course not one we made up. It's an homage to the show [Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)), where the Cylons are a race of sentient robots and the primary antagonists of the show. A key plot point is that any and all networked computers are dangerous due to the Cylon's overwhelming ability to infiltrate the networks and any connected systems. Yolol has the potential to eventually provide incredibly powerful networked systems with the ability to control nearly all devices in the game, remarkably reminiscent of Cylons. Also Starbase is a game about spaceships like Battlestar Galactica and we play robots which are vaguely similar to Cylon, so it all seemed to fit.
